# Logging Messages

Log entries may be generated by a variety of different interfaces.  If you wish to implement CFML error logging within your application, you may do so by simply installing the `logstash` module as a dependency:

```
box install logstash
```

Once this module is installed, and registered on the initialization of the framework, any log entries above the `levelMax` setting for the module, will be sent to the configured logging indices

## CFML Logging

## Javascript Logging

See [Javascript Error Logging](JavascriptLogging.md)

## Filebeat Logging

Logs may also be generated by installing the [FileBeat binary](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html) at the server level. Because these log messages may contain a wide variety of data, they are tracked an managed separately in the Stachebox UI.
